The generation fitness curve demonstrates the trend of fitness levels across successive generations, reflecting the overall progress and adaptation of the population.

## Steps to Run

To run the simulation:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Adjust parameters as needed for your experiment.
4. Execute the main script `get_result.py`.
5. Genotype information would be saved in output.csv
6. Analyze the results and visualize the data using provided tools or scripts.
